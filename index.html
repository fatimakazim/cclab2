                <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p>SN-1 reproduces through fragmentation, breaking into two or more fragments that develop into new
                        individuals.
                        Though it can potentially reproduce, biologists state that the reproduction of SN-1 only happens
                        in rare cases with unknown reasons or causes.

                <h3>Adaptations</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p> SN-1 can survive in a wide range of marine water bodies. It can live through areas with ocean
                        surface temperatures ranging from 31 degrees Celsius to -2 degrees Celsius and from the ocean
                        surface to a depth of 2,500 meters!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Interesting Fact!</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p>We know that SN-1 doesn't like attention, and it hates when things get close to it. It changes
                        its pupil color to black to avoid attention at night or when the lights are closed. That way,
                        SN-1 makes itself less visible in the dark.</p>

                <h3>Name and Appearance</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p>The name "SN-1" comes from where it is found and the order in which the unknown creatures are
                        found.
                        "S" means sea creature; "N" means north; and "1" means that it is the first unknown creature
                        that the team found in the area.
                        SN-1 has a black ball-shaped body, an eye at the center, and a pupil that changes color
                        depending on the situation.
                        The pupil is blue most of the time.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Where it is Found</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p> SSN-1 was found near the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in the North Pacific Ocean.
                        The ocean water in that area is highly polluted with toxic chemical disposal from factories and
                        energy-generating constructions.
                        The team found the creature floating alone close to the water's surface and tried to search for
                        similar species; however, they found none.
                        SN-1 is currently placed in one of the specially-made glass tanks in a secret laboratory under
                        the observation of a group of biologists.

                <h3>Behavior and Reactions</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p> SN-1 spent most of its time slowly floating and looking around its surroundings.
                        It is very cautious of almost any moving object that is bigger than itself. Once something
                        appears in its sight, its eye will lock on the subject until the subject disappears.
                        Getting too close to it might turn on its stress response, where it starts to shake, open its
                        eye wider, and its pupil turns red.
                        The stress response remains for a short period, opening its eyes wide for a few seconds after
                        the subject leaves.
                        However, the pupil immediately changes to its initial color(blue) once the subject moves away.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>What does it eat</h3>
                <div class="bp">
                    <p>It feeds directly on micro-bacteria that can also tolerate the toxic pollutants in the ocean
                        water.
                        Often, those bacteria flow in the toxic water along with the gas formed through chemical
                        reactions and decomposition in the water.
                        Surprisingly, if you place the creature into normal ocean water, it can also consume
                        micro-bacteria that are commonly seen there!
                        In other words, it feeds on almost every type of bacteria that live in salt water.</p>
